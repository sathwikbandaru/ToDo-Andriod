## Description of project

This is a simple ToDo list application in which we can manage all our day to day tasks.
I have used React Native to build this application.
React Native lets us build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting us compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. With React Native, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app; you build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

### App functionalities

-Click on Add Task button to add our tasks, a model will appear which asks us about task title, description and deadline to complete the task.
-It also asks us the priority level of task as low, medium, high.
-After adding a task we can edit that.
-We can mark our task as complted or pending using the button provided.
